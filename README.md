Software Engineer with a strong interest in algorithms, data structures, coding competitions, backend, web, mobile, cloud computing, and all aspects of software. I enjoy pushing myself outside of my comfort zone, seeking challenging experiences, and using my skills to solve problems.

## Some Projects

- [**GuruIA**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guruia) - A mobile app used by over 50k students to study for exams. It is available on the [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/guru-ia/id6469240984) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guruia). The app uses AI to generate answers based on students' questions from text, audio, or images. (The repository is private because it is a company project).

- [**AjudaAqui**](https://ajudaaqui.net/) - An startup that I start building that connects people who need help with your home exercises with professionals that can help them. (The repository is private because it is a company project).
